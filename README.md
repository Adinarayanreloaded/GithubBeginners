## Make-pull-request
It's an initiative by Chandigarh University students to help create more awareness about Open Source and help introduce many more students to the benefits of GitHub. We will organize lots of events, this is our humble step.

Lots of students struggle in creating their first PR. They try somewhat and leave when couldn't. We created this as learning repo on how to create successful pull requests on every possible language like JAVA, Python, JavaScript, Android, C++, HTML, CSS, etc.

You can look at the issues [here](https://github.com/geekyvyas/GithubBeginners/issues) and choose which one you would like to work on! 

## Hacktoberfest 2020 Special

- We will be posting a problem daily at 11 AM related to all languages like HTML, Python, JavaScript, JAVA, C++, Android, etc till 30th Oct.

- We will assign it to the person we find most fit among all the students who have requested.

- Person have time till 8 PM to submit, if fails to do so we will assign to someone else.

- Make sure you take from latest code and don't edit any other file. Save your file by name Date.(language extension) like 3rdOct.java, 3rdOct.py, 7thOct.js
